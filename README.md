# NixOS & NixDarwin configs

## Flakes
Default - NixOS config with Hyprland assumed an AMD GPU setup. Themed for Catppuccin
Also setup for Gaming + Steam (again based on having an AMD GPU)

Mac - Split between my personal and work Macs, includes Homebrew integration

## Development
Includes my full Neovim config. Has been kept as a standard lua config, purposely not migrated to Nix by personal preference

Nix-Direnv and Direnv enabled
